As part of my Major Research Project in the University of Limerick, I am carrying out a study to investigate the process by which people make moral judgements under the supervision of Dr Cillian McHugh. This information sheet will tell you what the study is about, and the possible risk and benefits associated with it. If you agree to take part, we will ask you to complete a Consent Form, declaring that you consent to take part.

What is the study about?

This study aims to investigate the process by which people make moral judgements.

What will I have to do?

Your participation is entirely voluntary. If you initially decide to take part, you can subsequently change your mind and withdraw from the study at any time and without the need to give any reason or justify your decision.

If you agree to participate you will be asked a series of questions relating to moral judgements. You will be presented with four moral scenarios and you will be asked to rate the behaviour of the characters described in the scenario.  You will then be asked to complete several standardised questionnaires. The entire study should be finished within fifteen to twenty minutes.

What are the benefits?

Studies like these can make an important contribution to our understanding of the factors affecting how people make decisions relating to moral issues. As such, the findings from this study may be presented at national and international conferences and may be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. However, no individual participant will be identified in any publication or presentation. Individuals will not be offered any monetary or other rewards for their participation.

What are the risks?

This study is investigating the factors influencing the making of moral judgements. The scenarios you will be presented with involve taboo behaviours that may cause offence or distress. This may make you uncomfortable, or it may be upsetting or distressing to you.  The disturbing nature of the scenarios may be compared with what you might expect from watching an 18 rated movie. You are reminded that participation is voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time.

What if I do not want to take part?

Participation is voluntary so you do not have to take part in the study if you do not want to; there is no penalty for not participating.

What happens to the information?

Electronic data will be stored in a password protected database and will be held for a period of 7 years. Anonymised data will be stored indefinitely and may be made available to other researchers in the field through the Open Science Framework.  The Open Science Framework (OSF) is an open source software project that facilitates open collaboration in science research.  Researchers can upload data, analysis and other research materials, making them publicly available for use by other researchers in the field.  The research will act in accordance to the data protection act.

 What happens if I change my mind during the study?

At any stage should you feel that you want to stop taking part in the study, you are free to stop and take no further part.  There are no consequences for changing your mind about being in the study. 

 Who can I contact if I have any questions or want to find out more about the study? 

If you have any further questions about the research you can contact:

a form of radium for which a druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost
him to make. The sick woman’s husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to
borrow the money, but he could only get together about half of what it costs.
He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper
or let him pay later. But the druggist said, “No, I discover the drug and I’m
going to make money from it.” So, Heinz got desperate and broke into the man’s

The lab prepares human cadavers that are used to teach medical students about
anatomy. The cadavers come from people who had donated their body for the
general use of researchers in the lab. The bodies are normally cremated;
however, severed cuts may be disposed of at the discretion of lab researchers. One
night, Jennifer is leaving the lab when she sees a body that is going to be
discarded the next day. Jennifer was a vegetarian, for moral reasons. She
thought it was wrong to kill animals for food. But then, when she saw a body
about to be cremated, she thought it was irrational to waste perfectly edible
meat. So, she cut off a piece of flesh, and took it home and cooked it. The
person has died recently of a heart attack, and she cooked the meat thoroughly,
so there was no risk of disease.

Incest has largely been understood to be wrong and unethical because of the risk of passing on recessive disorders due to closeness in the family tree. However, that risk is comparable to the general population of heterosexual couples. If one has to logically think about why incest is wrong (which is still practised in many communities) one really couldn't come up with an answer. The advancement of human beings is probably the result of incestuous relationships over centuries. I don't see anything wrong with what they did. It could complicate their future relationships and social standing (since incest is a taboo) if the secret got out, but there is nothing inherently wrong about it.",6,5,24,1,5,3,1,4,2,1,4,,6,6,15,1,1,7,8,16,"Paul endangered the life of an unaware man who had nothing to do with the current situation.

All preceding events led to the event wherein the five people were lying on the tracks about to be hit by a trolly.

If there was any other way to save those five people, without putting the life of the fat guy in danger, like throwing a big boulder to stop the trolley, one would have done it in an instant. However, there was no such option. Endangering the life of an unaware and unassuming human being to save those already in danger is unfair to the former.

I do not think Jennifer did anything wrong in consuming human meat. This is because, the person had consented to being available for scientific research post his death. Also, the person was dead and hence Jennifer did not commit homicide. Thirdly, the moral dilemma arises because cannibalism is a taboo. Especially, when it comes to human beings, who have managed to ascend to the rank of the most superior species on Earth. Due to our advanced cognitive capabilities, it gets lost in thought that man is nothing more than a category in the Class Mammals alongside several others who are consumed by man. Why the rules should be any different for man does not make sense to me.
