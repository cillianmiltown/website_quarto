>**Aims**: Given the risk of developing vicarious trauma through news media has increased during the pandemic, we explored
risk factors associated with media induced secondary trauma, and its behavioral and psychological implications.
**Methods**: An international study (N = 1066), with a diverse sample, was administered in July 2020. We used standardized
and validated questionnaires to measure news consumption, media-related trauma, compliance, and paranoia.
**Results**: Greater frequency of news consumption, accessing news via social media and WHO, and believing in conspiracy
theories increased likelihood of developing media-induced secondary trauma. News related trauma was associated with
greater compliance with safety measures and increased paranoid ideation. Media-trauma however exhibited a greater
association with paranoia than compliance.
**Conclusion**: Findings highlight the need to facilitate a collaborative intervention, with public, media houses, health safety
officials, and social scientists to have a deeper understanding of potential psychological costs of news consumption patterns
