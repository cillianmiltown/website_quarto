Hi Team,

Firstly, well done on collecting some high quality data. I have looked through the responses to some of the open-ended response questions, and your participants really engaged with the task and provided some rich data.

There were a lot of drop-outs leading to missing data. I included participants who provided partial data if they provided a response to the variable of interest for any of the four scenarios (feel free to remove participants with partial data in your own analyses if this is preferred).

I screened the open-ended responses following the critical slide for nonsense responses and removed any participant who provided nonsense responses to this question for any scenario.

It is possible that other participants that warrant removal will be found during the analysis.

I have created 2 spss files; a "long" one and a "wide" one. The Wide one has 1 row per participant, and the variables of interest are prefixed with the relevant scenario. The Long one has 4 rows per participant, with the variables of interest grouped by scenario. I have included an additional variable "scenario" so the responses for individual scenarios are identifiable. An outline of the variable names is below:

# initial_judgement           :  Ju1
# initial_reason              :  reason
# initial_confidence          :  conf1

# still wrong 1               :  still1
# counter argument reason     :  reason1
# counter argument 2          :  ca2
# still wrong 2               :  still2
# counter argument reason 2   :  reason2
# counter argument 3          :  ca3
# still wrong 3               :  still3
# counter argument reason 3   :  reason3
# critical slide              :  CS
# critical slide reason       :  reason_CS
# revised judgement           :  ju2
