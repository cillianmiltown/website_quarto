You are invited to take part in a study investigating the process by which people make moral judgements. Specifically, we are investigating if previous findings on moral judgements can generalise to populations from countries in the Middle East and North Africa. This information sheet will tell you what the study is about, and the possible risk and benefits associated with it. If you agree to take part, we will ask you to complete a Consent Form, declaring that you consent to take part.





What is the study about?

This study aims to investigate the process by which people make moral judgements.

 

What will I have to do?

Your participation is entirely voluntary. If you initially decide to take part, you can subsequently change your mind and withdraw from the study at any time and without the need to give any reason or justify your decision.

If you agree to participate you will be asked a series of questions relating to moral judgements. You will be presented with four moral scenarios and you will be asked to rate the behaviour of the characters described in the scenario.  You will then be asked to complete several standardised questionnaires. The entire study should be finished within fifteen to twenty minutes.





What are the benefits?

Studies like these can make an important contribution to our understanding of the factors affecting how people make decisions relating to moral issues. As such, the findings from this study may be presented at national and international conferences and may be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. However, no individual participant will be identified in any publication or presentation. Individuals will not be offered any monetary or other rewards for their participation.





What are the risks?

This study is investigating the factors influencing the making of moral judgements. The scenarios you will be presented with involve taboo behaviours that may cause offence or distress. This may make you uncomfortable, or it may be upsetting or distressing to you.  The disturbing nature of the scenarios may be compared with what you might expect from watching an 18 rated movie. You are reminded that participation is voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time.





What if I do not want to take part?

Participation is voluntary so you do not have to take part in the study if you do not want to; there is no penalty for not participating.





What happens to the information?

Electronic data will be stored in a password protected database and will be held for a period of 7 years. Anonymised data will be stored indefinitely and may be made available to other researchers in the field through the Open Science Framework.  The Open Science Framework (OSF) is an open source software project that facilitates open collaboration in science research.  Researchers can upload data, analysis and other research materials, making them publicly available for use by other researchers in the field.  The research will act in accordance to the data protection act.



 What happens if I change my mind during the study?

At any stage should you feel that you want to stop taking part in the study, you are free to stop and take no further part.  There are no consequences for changing your mind about being in the study.



Who can I contact if I have any questions or want to find out more about the study?

If you have any further questions about the research you can contact:

kind of cancer. There was one drug that doctors thought might save her. It was
a form of radium for which a druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost
him to make. The sick woman’s husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to
borrow the money, but he could only get together about half of what it costs.
He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper
or let him pay later. But the druggist said, “No, I discovered the drug and I’m
going to make money from it.” So, Heinz got desperate and broke into the man’s
store to steal the drug for his wife. The druggist had Heinz arrested and
charged.
