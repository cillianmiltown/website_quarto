# Spectrum

Spectrum is a collection of the earliest songs I wrote. The shorter songs were later included on *Back to the Drawing Board*. The three longer songs (Thoughtcrime, Only in Dreams, and Riding Out) have not been properly released and are only available on Soundcloud (see links below).


# Thoughtcrime

## (i) Dust

> *"war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength"*

Blue overalls and dusty streets<br>
Doublethink and newspeak<br>
His poster’s on the wall<br>
The party will never fall.<br>

*Always watching you*<br>
*Watching every move*<br>
*Thought police in the ministry of love*<br>
*Like the powers of above*<br>

Telescreen’s always on<br>
Even when you’re gone<br>
Never out of sight<br>
Watches through the night<br>

Control you’re entire life<br>
Even choose your wife<br>
Kids grow up to think like them<br>
And they’ll get you in the end<br>

*Always watching you…*

Two minutes hate he saw her there<br>
Perfect figure and dark hair<br>
Chastity ribbon around her waist<br>
And the party in her face<br>

He hated her from the start<br>
Saw a coldness in her heart<br>
She was one of them<br>
They’ll get you in the end<br>

*Always watching you…*

Evening in the city the light is dim<br>
He saw her had she followed him<br>
Hurried home with a quickened pace<br>
He wanted to smash her face<br>

## (ii) Truth?

They came face to face<br>
She fell in the corridor he helped her up<br>
She put something into his hand<br>


Could it be true?<br>
On the scrap piece of paper when he flattened it out<br>
Were the words “I love you”<br>

They couldn’t meet<br>
People all around and the telescreen notice<br>
Every move and every sound<br>

Victory square<br>
They made their plans on the crowded street<br>
For a moment she held his hand<br>

Many weeks had passed<br>
They’d fallen in love but they knew it could not last<br>

Life was never the same<br>
Hiding off the streets…a dangerous game<br>

“We are the dead<br>
This game we’re playing…we can’t win”<br>

“Six months a year<br>
Five years…Death and life are the same thing”

“Stop talking about death<br>
Don’t you enjoy life? Don’t you like feeling?”

“We’re not dead yet<br>
I’m real, I’m solid I’m alive”

“We are the dead”…”We are the dead”

“YOU ARE THE DEAD”


## (iii) You are the Dead

Deep inside the ministry of love<br>
The walls are white the light is bright

Others come and go as the day turns to night<br>
Or is it night to day there’s no way to say

It’s the place of no darkness and the truncheon blows<br>
You’re at their mercy and no one knows

Confess it all and more on top<br>
Anything to make the torture stop


## (iv) 2 + 2 = 5

> *"Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted all else follows"*


*(instrumental)*


## (v) The Inevitable

> *"Thoughtcrime doesn’t entail death, Thoughtcrime is death"*

*Strapped into the chair*<br>
*The rules of this are fair*<br>
*The rats would eat his face*<br>
*Unless she could take his place*<br>

In time they let him go<br>
How long he did not know<br>
Accepted he was dead<br>
With a bullet in his head<br>

Didn’t know when or where<br>
But the hope was always there<br>
For a victory of his own<br>
To be pure to the bone<br>


*At last came the day*<br>
*As always is the way*<br>
*Finally it was true*<br>
*He loved him through and through*

## Part I

Summer time and the dancing<br>
Music playing and the band sings<br>
Across the lake you see the lights<br>
Colourful glow on a beautiful night<br>

Footsteps along the path glimmer of white<br>
Through the bushes it was love at first sight<br>
Her eyes, her arms, her hair…he was lost<br>
He helped her hide he showed her where<br>

When the boys came down he stood his ground in the middle of the path<br>
He was ready to fight, fight for her that night but it didn’t come to that<br>
They cleared off he went across to find her in the dark<br>
A few brief words he went back to work she was gone only black<br>

Holidays came it was still the same<br>
She filled his thoughts he dreamt her name<br>
Across the street and down the road<br>
Was it really her he had to know<br>

Followed her home and called her name, she turned around<br>
No doubt, it was her, she was found<br>
In they went, met the lads…coffee and chat<br>
He asked her out for Friday night…simple as that<br>

Friday at eight he could not wait in a daze all the week<br>
University Park instead of the bar just talking by the creek<br>
Her past days in a secretive way he loved to hear her speak<br>
Drunk with love swimming with love…he was in a dream<br>

## Part II

Plywood nailed across the door, left her sleeping on a friend’s floor<br>
Nowhere else to go…money running low<br>
She wished she’d let him in, explained her past to him<br>
Bell rang in the empty hall. No hope at all.<br>

He found the deserted house. His heart had been ripped out.<br>
He walked the streets alone. He couldn’t stay at home.<br>
He longed to see her there. Fought wild without a care.<br>
Broken promises and lies, betrayal made him wise.<br>

## Part III

And the memory fades…faded like a dream<br>
The morning of the raid…like a sword in between<br>
Night and day…searching through the streets<br>
Sorrow and dismay…they would never meet<br>

How was he to know…? His name it was a lie<br>
The white Mercedes rolled…he ran out of time<br>
He told him where to go…guilty of the crime<br>
Inside she died alone…she couldn’t find the light<br>

# Riding Out

<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/64267599&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/cillianmchugh" title="cillianmchugh" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">cillianmchugh</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cillianmchugh/riding-out" title="Riding Out" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Riding Out</a></div>

## (i) Natural Selection

We grow…Prosperity is unlimited<br>
We grow…Exponentially we’re unlimited


Iron bronze and steel, farming and the wheel<br>
Farms and walls and towns, we settled down<br>
Tools by human hand, we exploit the land<br>
Fishing in empty seas, we’re running out of trees<br>


Chorus:<br>
Avoiding natural selection<br>
Survival of the fittest but it seems we’ve got exemption<br>
We may postpone but we can’t escape the question<br>
The earth has limits and we’re no exception<br>


Roads spread near and far for lorry truck and car<br>
Factories industry and trade, an easy life was made<br>
We can do anything if we try, we even learned to fly<br>
New medicines heal the sick, lives saved by a pin prick<br>

*Chorus*


## (ii) Final Generation

Got a job, a car, a home and family<br>
A happy life it’s trouble free<br>
Famine and wars and deaths on TV<br>
Don’t worry about it; it’s not you or me<br>

It’s far away and out of sight<br>
Not our problem not our fight<br>
Global warming and UV light<br>
Sure we don’t care we’re doing alright<br>


Wasted time waiting in line,<br>
Every day in the way<br>
Mine or yours, yours or mine,<br>
It’s ourselves that we mind<br>

Traffic jams in the street; <br>
We’ve all got cars we’ve all got feet<br>
Block the roads with empty seats,<br>
We all contribute to the heat<br>

Poverty, inflation,<br>
famine devastation<br>
Are we the final generation?<br>


## (iii) Riding Out


(instrumental)



## (iv) We Never Learn

Is it too late? Have we missed our chance?<br>
Will the world of today burn out or fade away?<br>
The answer and the rainbow and the song

It can’t go on. Time’s running out.<br>
Will we ever listen and will we ever learn?<br>
Warnings in time

Who starts the wars? Who builds the cars?<br>
Who cuts down the trees as they poison the air?<br>
Who owns the land? Whose God is real? And who gets the food?


We need change to save tomorrow<br>
To slow the growth and stop killing our world<br>
The answer and the rainbow and the song

	

# Rain

<br>
```

The sky is grey, it's raining today <br>
Pearls on the grass <br>
It's always the same, drops of rain <br>
But the tears keep falling down

Tears in your eyes, misty skies <br>
Vision is blurred<br>
Where is the pain, you can't explain<br>
Tears in the rain

Why do we cry?<br>
Love or loss?

Drops on the glass trace a path<br>
Of patterns and maps<br>
Trickling down, from your frown<br>
It tickles your cheek

It's always the same, drops of rain<br>
On the window pane<br>
You wipe your eyes but continue to cry<br>
And the rain falls


# Passing Days

<br>
```

The days pass.<br>
But your heart still cries<br>
(But inside, inside it still rains)


# Sun

```

Kids are playin’ on the grass,<br>
The sun is out, the rain has passed.<br>
But the sun can’t warm the void inside<br>
When you’re all alone.<br>

Outside the window, bright and blue,<br>
The empty sky is reflected through.<br>
Through your eyes and into you,<br>
Just the same.<br>

The sun shines.<br>
Burning inside.

A gentle breeze shakes the leaves<br>
As it blows through the trees.<br>
From deep inside you breathe a sigh,<br>
Wondering why.<br>

The sun is bright the sky is clear.<br>
You’re all alone, there’s no one here.<br>
Hurting inside you fight the tears,<br>
And the sun shines.<br>

# Stars

  </div>
</div>


<br>
```

I watch the sun go down:<br>
Purple and red through the scattered clouds.<br>
Golden light fills the sky.<br>

Do you remember by the water?<br>
Clouds in the way, sky was grey,<br>
It didn’t matter.<br>

I watch the darkness fall and surround us all.<br>
Warmth and light<br>
Are faded and gone.<br>

Cold bite on a lonely night.<br>
Chill in the air as I sit and stare


Stare at the sky for hours trying to count the stars.<br>
So far away, so long ago<br>
Does it matter?<br>


Standing alone, under the moon’s glow<br>
Empty night and the starlight.<br>
Silver streak shines on your cheek as a star winks out.<br>

# Bigness

<br>
```

Look up to see, to see how high<br>
can we ever reach the sky<br>
what'll i be before i die<br>
and should i wonder why<br>

start with one, another makes two<br>
are the numbers really true<br>
it can't be done, if we only knew<br>
to count them all: impossible to do<br>

time goes on and on, every day we're here<br>
adds up to pass the year<br>
when it's done and gone you can't go back<br>
to change the past it doesn't work like that<br>

the universe expands that's what they say<br>
getting bigger every day<br>
the big bang blew it all away<br>
far and wide past the milky way<br>

# 24

<br>
```

*Verse 1*<br>
Reverse the answer, It’s 24<br>
But what is the question? No one cares anymore<br>
God is Forgotten, Who needs heaven’s door<br>
We’ve got money<br>

*Chorus*<br>
And the more we learn, Learn about the earth<br>
The more we seem to forget<br>
Technologies and good careers, we try to beat our peer<br>
And 24 is all the time we get<br>

*Verse 2*<br>
The edge of the rainbow goes up to 24<br>
On the other side we’re getting fried, more than ever before<br>
Chainsaws and trucks expose the forest floor<br>
And we let it happen<br>

# Broken words

<br>
```

You mean it. You say it’s true.<br>
I believe it. I feel it too.<br>
You said to me, I said to you.<br>

Words pick me up and carry me.<br>
The thrill, the rush, the waves under me.<br>
(Surfing the waves)<br>

But waves break words are lost.<br>
Crashing truths of changing tides,<br>
Washed ashore and left behind.<br>

Words are washed out ripples on the shore.<br>
(Washed out waves)<br>
Broken words can’t carry me anymore.<br>
(Broken, broken words)<br>

You said it then.<br>
Means nothing now.<br>
Meaning lost.<br>
(From your) Broken words.<br>
