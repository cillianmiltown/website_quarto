What if you, if you were in my shoes?<br>
Would they fit? And would they keep you warm?<br>
What if you, if you were in my shoes?<br>
What have I missed?<br>

Time...<br>
Time...<br>
Time...<br>
Goes on, moves fast<br>

Stealing words of green tinted blue<br>
Shadows of what we thought we knew<br>
No more...<br>

... time<br>
... time<br>
... time<br>
is caught up, is made up<br>

All good things come to an end<br>
All good things come to an end<br>

You don’t want them to<br>
You don’t want them to<br>

And all you’ve lived and all you own,<br>
and all you’ve learned an all you’ve known<br>
And all you’ve worked and all you’ve done<br>
And everything you’ve become<br>

And you don’t even know<br>
And you don’t even know<br>
And you don’t even know<br>
And you don’t even know<br>

And those you’ve loved and those you’ve known<br>
And those you’ve seen and those you’ve shown<br>
The ones who knew and understood<br>
The ones you thought would stay for good<br>

And you have to say goodbye<br>
And you have to say goodbye<br>
And you have to say goodbye<br>
And you have to say goodbye<br>

There are no words, there are no words, there's just hanging on <br>
And holding out, and holding on, until it's gone<br>
Your broken heart, your broken heart, you thought had healed<br>

You check the screen, you check the screen for any sign<br>
For her reply, for her reply, but you know inside<br>
The empty screen and what that means, it's all you feel<br>

You came too close, you got too close, like you did before<br>
And every time, and every time, no matter what you try<br>
Will come again, will come again...<br>

Chances that I blew<br>
And candles that I knew<br>
And all now, as I see<br>
Is all<br>

People said, and tears were shed<br>
We both knew it could only ever be<br>
as unknown arms wrapped around me<br>
unknown arms wrapped around me<br>
unknown arms wrapped around me<br>

Chances that I blew<br>
and candles that I knew,<br>
And all<br>
Is all<br>

All night tears were shed<br>
We both knew it could only ever be<br>
as unknown arms wrapped around me<br>
unknown arms wrapped around me<br>
unknown arms wrapped around me<br>

Smells like summer rain<br>
Smells like summer rain<br>
The path is wet<br>
But the air is warm<br>

Feels like summer rain<br>
Feels like summer rain<br>
My clothes are damp<br>
but my skin is warm<br>

-

Memories of the past<br>
Memories of the past<br>
What I've learned<br>
And what didn't last<br>

*Chorus 1*<br>
And I know I'm too young to know<br>
But I've asked those questions long ago<br>
And April rain<br>
Still falls<br>

And I know<br>
She's right but she's wrong<br>
And passing showers<br>
Only last so long<br>

-

Memories of the past<br>
Of games on the path<br>
Memories of the past<br>
What's changed and what can last<br>

Smells like summer rain<br>
Smells like summer rain<br>
What I've learned<br>
And what's the same<br>

*Chorus 2*<br>
And I know what I want to know<br>
And I've seen it happen, I've seen it grow<br>
While April rain<br>
Still falls<br>

And I know<br>
It's right but it's wrong<br>
And passing showers<br>
Only last so long<br>

Walking home across the city from the train to the plane<br>
You're on your own, there's no pity there's no pain in vain<br>
When you said good-bye on the platform this time<br>
Like you said good-bye the first time<br>

You know this place by day but it's night this time<br>
Cold breeze on your face, night air and the city lights shine<br>
Across the water reflect the sights<br>
Across the water you'll trek tonight<br>

Growing apart, time and distance will take their toll<br>
But in your heart you know it's wort it to make you whole<br>
The signs are there but hope remains<br>
'Cause love is to share, it's worth the strain<br>

Back on land back to normal doubt left behind<br>
You're almost home, just the drive and in your mind<br>
You count the days till the next time<br>
Like you count the days each time

What if the best advice was wrong?<br>
Advice you followed for too long.<br>
And you turn to the bottle or the rolling good times,<br>
Did you find it there? Do you even care?<br>

I remember the secret joy,<br>
I remember your voice......<br>
........your eyes.....<br>

I don't know if i care for you,<br>
And I don't know if you want me to.<br>
I don't know.............<br>
....You.....<br>

I don't care if you miss me too<br>
Coz I don't care (how I felt for you)<br>
Coz if I care.......<br>
I'd care<br>

Too many times,<br>
But it will pass and come again,<br>
As history plays out, the cycle comes round again.<br>
And it's back to the drawing board but you know its the same song over again<br>
same song over again.....same song over again<br>

You can only be a happy fool for so long,<br>
Till you have to face the truth and accept that you've got it wrong.<br>
And poets of the past speak truths that will always last<br>
And the band sings your heart, drawing distractions<br>

Too many times,<br>
But it will pass and come again.

And you know it’s done, and you know it’s too late to talk<br>
‘cause nothing you can say, and nothing you can do will change what’s come<br>
And you always knew this day could come,<br>
But your heart still believed<br>

Believed you could overcome, believed she was the one,<br>
You tried to make it work, you thought you could make it work,<br>
And even when the cracks began to show,<br>
You never gave up hope<br>

The four leaf charm, to hang on her arm,<br>
The phone call in the sun, remembering as one, one last time<br>
Back to how it used to be<br>
and what we had.<br>

Two months on, the time you bought is gone,<br>
Today’s flight home, the last flight home<br>

Sitting three cars back from the red light<br>
The fan's on full, and the windows are down<br>
The light's change as you wipe the sweat from your face<br>

But the oncoming cars<br>
Mean nothing is going right<br>
And you're stuck three cars back<br>
And you're going nowhere<br>

Take out your phone and glance at the screen<br>
Still no reply, or answer to be see<br>
And you know that it's worth waiting for<br>
But you know that you've been here before<br>

And is that all this is?<br>
Just another drunken kiss?<br>
And you're three cars back<br>
And you're going nowhere<br>

He tries to speak his mind and he finds the line but the words that he chose don't fit,<br>
He tries to hide behind the disguise but he's blind in the maze that he built himself,<br>
And he knows he shouldn't worry<br>
And he knows that its only a song and that<br>
There really is no hurry<br>
But at the same time<br>

It's been a long long time and he's falling behind and he feels he's losing touch<br>
It's been a long long time and its on his mind and he knows that that's enough<br>
It's been a long time he knows<br>
It's been a long time he knows<br>

He tries to sing his song but its been so long, the chords sound wrong and the melody's gone<br>
He's forgotten the lines that were in his mind, he can't shake the feeling that he's stealing from someone<br>
And he knows there's something better<br>
And he knows that a reason will come<br>
And the next time will sound better<br>
But at the same time<br>

It's been a long long time and he's falling behind and he feels he's losing touch<br>
It's been a long long time and its on his mind and he knows that that's enough<br>
It's been a long time he knows<br>
It's been a long time he knows<br>
