In response to [this](https://perso.uclouvain.be/vincent.yzerbyt/Yzerbyt%20et%20al.%20JPSP%202018.pdf) paper by Yzerbyt, Batailler and Judd (2018) which outined a new method of conducting mediation analyses (with less susceptability to false positives than Hayes' PROCESS) I created a ShinyApp so that their R-package could be used by SPSS users. Upload your SPSS file below and select the variables you wish to compare.
